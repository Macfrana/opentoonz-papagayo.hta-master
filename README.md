# opentoonz-papagayo.hta
It's a very handy hta/javascript gui that inserts and converts a papagayo voice.dat in a copy of your existing toonzfile and saves it to a new opentoonz scenefile.

To use it, you must make mouthshapes for your character. 
The .hta file has a variable containing which frame numbers to use. 
Use or adjust these to suit your character. Use the same format as shown now ( 0001 - 0011 ).

It uses preston blair format for now.

var mapObj = {
   rest:"0007",
   AI:"0001",
   E:"0002",
   O:"0003",
   U:"0004",
   etc:"0005",
   WQ:"0006",
   MBP:"0007",
   L:"0008",
   FV:"0009"
};


# Converting the papagayo stuff 
1> Select your opentoonz (template) file

2> Select your papagayo file

3> select the level(s) you want to insert the keyframes in.

4> convert and save to new scenefile

I'm using an updated version of papagayo that has better language support. Get it here:
